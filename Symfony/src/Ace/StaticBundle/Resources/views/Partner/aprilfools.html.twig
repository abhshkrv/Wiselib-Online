			Welcome to codebender's April Fool's Day Special page. At codebender, we really, really like pranks, and we
			don't wait around for April Fool's to play a good practical joke on each other. Having said that, we also
			respect April Fool's Day as a celebration of practical pranks, with significantly reduced chance of getting
			angry friends and spouses chasing after you. Thus, in collaboration with Olympia Circuits and Digistump, we
			decided to seize the opportunity to add some spice in our everyday lives. Behold, two sketches for proud
			Arno (or any Arduino Leonardo-compatible device for that matter) and Digispark owners.
		</p>
		<p>
			To use these sketches, you will need to install our browser plugin (works best for Firefox and Chrome). We
			also <strong>strongly encourage</strong> you to follow our
			<a href="{{ path("AceStaticBundle_plugin") }}">Getting Started Guide</a>, which takes care of all the
			requirements, like device drivers for Windows and Mac and device permissions for Linux. For more info on the
			plugin, you can visit our
			<a href="{{ path("AceStaticBundle_walkthrough", {"page":1}) }}">plugin info page</a>.

		<h3>Arno & Arduino Leonardo Mouse Prank</h3>
		<p>
			If you have an Arno or an Arduino Leonardo, check out this sketch by Olympia Circuits, the makers of Arno.
			Load the code to your device, and connect it to an unsuspecting victim's computer. It will move their mouse
			at random intervals, and hopefully drive some poor person crazy.

		<h3>Digispark Caps Lock Prank</h3>
		<p>
			Straight from Digistump's sources comes this excellent prank. This sketch programs your Digispark to act as
			a keyboard, and randomly turns the Caps Lock on and off every 5-15 minutes. Program your Digispark and plug
			it to an unsuspected victim's computer. Please note, this will work on Windows and Linux, but it will
			probably not work on Mac OS X machines.
