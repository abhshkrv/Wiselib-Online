			<p>The micro-sized, Arduino enabled, usb development board - cheap enough to leave in any project!</p>

			<p>
				The Story: We set out to build a little brother to the wonderful Arduino line of development boards - we
				were tired of leaving our valuable Arduino's behind in projects, or worse, ripping apart old projects to
				build new ones! We also felt the Arduino was too big and powerful for many projects where we only needed
				a few pins, or an SPI or I2C bus. And so the Digispark was born!
			</p>
			<p>
				Plug it in, power your project with USB or external sources, and easily use existing Arduino code!
				But with its small size and low cost you can feel free to leave it in your project, give one to a
				friend, and use them everywhere! Just how small is it? Well it's about the size of a quarter.

		<p>The Specs:
		<ul>
			<li>Power via USB or External Source - 5v or 7-35v (automatic selection)</li>
			<li>On-board 500ma 5V Regulator</li>
			<li>Built-in USB (and serial debugging)</li>
			<li>6 I/O Pins (2 are used for USB only if your program actively communicates over USB, otherwise you can
