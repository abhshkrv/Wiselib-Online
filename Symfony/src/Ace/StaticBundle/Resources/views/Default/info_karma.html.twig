			<h3>What is karma?</h3>
			<p>
				Karma in Indian religions is the concept of "action" or "deed". Karma is not punishment or retribution
				but simply an extended expression or consequence of natural acts. Karma means "deed" or "act" and more
				broadly names the universal principle of cause and effect, action and reaction, that governs all life.
			</p>
			<h3>Karma in {{ site_name }}</h3>
			<p>
				In {{ site_name }}, karma is points you gain by helping others, inviting friends, and generally being a
				great guy (or gal). The more you help others, the more your karma increases. This is a way to track your
				popularity not only by "likes" from others or by the number of "followers" you have, but also in
				meaningful ways, like how much your actions are advancing our community and the Maker movement.
